## pmd-report-sorter

This is a simple java project to sort classes and methods according to the cyclomatic complexity given by the generated report of [PMD](https://pmd.github). By sorting according to the cyclomatic complexity in descending order it is possible to keep track of refactoring beginning with the highest cyclompatic complexity. You can use the PMD report "my-report.txt" as command line argument and the sorter will sort and generate the sorted result into a file named "my-report-sorted.txt" (it simply adds -sorted to the end).
